This plugin is named after the validates_as_phone plugin of Jerrod Blavos
(http://code.google.com/p/validates-as-phone/). Admittedly, this plugin was
built over the latter, but as the purposes of this plugin is more complex than
that of the minimal one, practically all of the code has been written over by
now.
